## Getting Started

Basic components required are:

1. Microcontroller (Atmega 328p-pu)
2. 2 seven segment anode display
3.
4. Power source
5. Wires (male to female and male to male wires)
6. A programmer (atml studio, proteus)
7. Board (copper board or bread board)
8. Wires

Set up the circuit as shown in the figure below

### Installing

To upload the code to the chip, 

run this code on atml studio and build it by pressing keyboad shortcut f7    
The following code compiles the code to a .hex file where you made a project files
and then open avr dudes and load the hex file and upload to atmega328p
